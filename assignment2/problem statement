Consider an order management operational database that tracks order numbers, dates, the requested ship dates, customers and their shipping and billing addresses, products and their quantity and gross dollar amount, sales representatives that take and process orders, the deals (promotions) and discounts proposed/offered to customers.
You have to design a data warehouse that will be updated from the above operational database and should support decision making by helping to answer analytical questions about the net order dollar amounts per customer, products, promotions or deals, and the performance of their sales representatives or agents.
Analysis of requested ship dates is important for analysis as well. It is also important to allow for performing order amount analysis in various currencies: dollars, dirhams, euros.
