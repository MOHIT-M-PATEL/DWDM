Consider a book management operational database that tracks different book types, cost, quantity, profit, location, authors and their age and country, publication name and their country and year. You have to design a data warehouse that will be updated from the above operational database and should support decision-making by helping to answer analytical questions about the quantity and profit made per book type, location, author, and publication.
1) Draw the star schema(s) showing the main attributes, including primary keys, foreign keys, and facts.
2) Insert appropriate values in the database. Write SQL statements that runs on your schema and return the quantity and profit made per book type, location, author, and publication.
